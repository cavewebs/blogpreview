No more incomplete sentences in cutting down long text
/* This functions cuts a long string in sentences.
    *
    * substr_sentence($string, $start, $limit);
    * $string = 'A example. By someone that loves PHP. Do you? We do!';
    * $start = 0; // we would start at the beginning
    * $limit = 10; // so, we get 10 sentences (not 10 words or characters!)
    *
    * It's not as substr()) in single characters.
    * It's not as substr_words() in single words.
    * 
    * No more broken lines in a story. The story/article must go on!
